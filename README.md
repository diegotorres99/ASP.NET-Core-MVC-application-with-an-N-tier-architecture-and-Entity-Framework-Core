This project is a CRUD application built with ASP.NET Core MVC, structured using an N-tier architecture and powered by Entity Framework Core. Designed to follow best practices for separation of concerns and scalability, it provides a robust framework for data-driven applications.

Technologies:

ASP.NET Core MVC: Manages application logic and user interactions through a Model-View-Controller framework.
N-Tier Architecture: Divides the application into distinct layers (UI, Business Logic, Data Access) to enhance maintainability and scalability.
Entity Framework Core: Facilitates seamless communication with the database, enabling efficient data handling and migration.
Features:

CRUD Operations: Complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality.
Data Access Layer (DAL): Uses Entity Framework Core for database management and repository pattern to simplify data operations.
Business Logic Layer (BLL): Manages business rules, validation, and complex processing, ensuring a clean separation of business and data logic.
Presentation Layer: Provides a responsive, user-friendly interface with ASP.NET Core MVC, handling the userâ€™s interaction with the application.
Entity Framework Migrations: Supports easy database migrations for evolving data models.
This project is ideal for developers seeking to understand and implement N-tier architecture with ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core, focusing on clean code organization and efficient data management.
